# Contributing

We’re still working out the kinks to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we’re not quite there yet. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear and answers some questions that you may have.

## Repository Organization

- NewBrige Network Website

## Branch Organization for Website

Submit all changes directly to the `main branch`. We don’t use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases. We do our best to keep `main` in good shape, with all tests passing. Any accepted changes in `main` will be automatically tested and deployed once the tests are passed. 

Code that lands in `main` must be compatible with the latest stable release. It may contain additional features, but no breaking changes. We should be able to release a new minor version from the tip of `main` at any time.

## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case.
