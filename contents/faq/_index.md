The NewBridge fee is used to maintain the operation of the system, that is, the fee consumed for transfers between NewChain and Ethereum. The specific calculation rules of the fee is: from the Ethereum cross-chain to NewChain, the fee is twice the ETH transfer gas fee and the double NEW transfer gas fee; from the NewChain cross-chain to the Ethereum, the fee is charged twice the NEW transfer gas Fee and double the ETH transfer gas fee. If it is an ERC20/NRC6 token, the transfer fee will be converted to the standard of the certificate based on the market price and then calculated accordingly. Due to the high volatility of the market, there may be deviations. NewBridge will adjust the fee regularly or irregularly. NewBridge itself does not earn any fees from users.
